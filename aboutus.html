        <p>
          A seasoned technology professional with extensive experience delivering solutions across industries in South Africa,
          Dawn is driving the creation of an AI-native business designed to operate across multiple sectors of the economy.
          The venture is built on three focus areas:
          <em>Advisory Services</em>, <em>Project Delivery Services</em>, and <em>Product Development</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The five-year vision is bold: to establish one of Africa's leading AI services and product development companies,
          with capabilities spanning the full AI value chain—from strategy to execution. To achieve this, the venture is seeking
          a strategic funder who can provide capital investment as well as project and operational support, ideally through
          equity partnership or structured debt funding.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core is the conviction that AI can serve as a national enabler—streamlining government services,
          reducing inefficiencies, empowering businesses, and strengthening communities. With strong operational leadership
          and the right investment, this business will become a dominant force in AI-driven transformation across Africa.

        <div class="role">Chief Legal Officer · Co-founder</div>
        <p>
          <strong>Disclosure:</strong> Not generated by ChatGPT. Who I Am: My journey as an advocate has been dedicated to one
          core principle: navigating complexity to find just outcomes for people. From the intricacies of labour disputes and
          complex civil claims to corporate litigation and foundational constitutional challenges, my work has always been at the
          intersection of systems and the human beings they are meant to serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see the coming wave of artificial intelligence not as a technological challenge, but as a profoundly human one.
          My vision is to ensure that our innovations are built with empathy and foresight. With a foundation in Labour Law,
          I bring a unique perspective on the profound impact AI will have on our workforce and society. My contribution is to
          ask the critical questions: How do we ensure fairness? How do we protect rights? How do we build systems that empower,
          rather than displace?
        </p>
        <p>
          While my partners masterfully build the technology, I will focus on its application, ensuring our solutions are not only
          powerful but also principled. My experience in corporate and civil law provides the framework to manage risk and ensure
          our innovations are commercially sound and legally robust. I am a builder of bridges—connecting the vast potential of AI
          with the practical, ethical, and legal realities of the world. This means embedding compliance into our products from the
          outset, upholding crucial legislation such as the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), and ensuring our legacy
          is one of responsible innovation that uplifts industries and empowers communities with integrity.

        <h3>Tommy Ferreira</h3>
        <div class="role">CTO · Co-founder</div>
        <p>
          I am a builder of systems and a strategist of transformation. For three decades I have worked at the frontlines of
          technology, from the early days of mainframes and networks to the current wave of artificial intelligence. My journey
          has never been about chasing trends, but about recognising when an innovation is ready to shift from theory into impact—
          and then creating the frameworks to make that impact real.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive in complexity. Whether stabilising failing operations, architecting resilient infrastructures, or unlocking new
          capabilities, my role has always been to see the whole board and move the right pieces at the right time. I have learned
          that true transformation does not come from technology alone, but from trust, timing, and execution discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a connector. I bring together advisory insight, delivery execution, and product innovation into a single continuum—
          ensuring that ideas do not die in strategy decks, but become measurable outcomes in the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of all, I am committed to a bigger vision: that artificial intelligence can be more than a tool of efficiency.
          It can be a national enabler—a force that streamlines systems, empowers businesses, and uplifts communities. My purpose
          is to ensure that this potential is realised responsibly, securely, and at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not just a technologist. I am a bridge between innovation and transformation. I am a strategist, builder, and
          enabler. I am thirty years of lessons turned into foresight for the future.
